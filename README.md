# Summary:

Bikesriding services are remarkably popular in the downtown and Newy York metropolitan area,  where occupied  residential houses and real estates and businesses surrounded by recreation parks  is densely packed and parking spaces are difficult. The number of male subscribers  is predominantly high than female riders. Bike riding is busiest  around morning and evening commute times on weekdays and also on weekends and Saturday between 11 to 4pm is the busiest time.


Recommendation/Suggestion 
I would pursue on additional inquiry regarding the city system  adding stations and docks to the existing service area to mprove system density and increase capacity, and  enabling more Citi Bike trips for the conmmunity.
